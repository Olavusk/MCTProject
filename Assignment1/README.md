# Noteable changes

From recommendation, i removed the total notes feature, and instead calculated average notesper bar, as that might be a more reasonable feature.

The result doesnt improve much, as a greater issue is the dataset. One problem is it contains "both hands" melodies, meaning its probably to complex melodies to make sense of using these features. Another problem is that there is probably not enough data do train on.

Some results still stand though, as mozart and bethoven _generally_ has more outliers than Tchaikovsky and Grieg as can be seen in the 3D PCA midi figure plot.
